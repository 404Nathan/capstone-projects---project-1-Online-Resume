    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>Excellent question! I am afraid I am still on search for that answer myself -- unfortunately, it is not me on the photo above. Apologies for getting your hopes up and making your soul weep.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>On a more serious and professional note, I am a self-taught developer... eh, that makes it seems as if I already know programming. Oi! Nathan from the future, it will be fun to go back to this first project of yours, won't it? Give it a year or two and pat yourself in the back. I am confident you can call yourself a self-taught programmer by then.</p>

    <p>I had given up learning programming thrice by now and every time I decided to give it another go, I started from scratch. It's soul crushing, really. That is why, I tattooed in my mind that this time is the time. It's a new year and a new beginning, yes? I am going to become a great programmer!</p>

    <h2>Education</h2>

    <p>Oh bother. This is not the way to sell myself, but honesty is the way to go. I didn't finished college. I enrolled twice and ended up dropping of both of them. Why, you may ask. The subjects and the teachers were a huge pain in the heart, I tell you.</p>

    <p>That, however, ain't stopping me from becoming a marvelous developer. Wait and see. Wait and see! I shall go back to this resume of mine and link countless projects I will have done all by myself. Wait and see, you.</p>

    <h2>Work Experience</h2>

    <p>Oiii!! What am I writing, really? A <b>"please, do not contact me"</b> resume?</p> 

    <p>Unfortunately, I have no work experience either. Care to change that, friend? *wink wink</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

    <p>A-ha! Here's my chance to prove I am something! I definitely do need to go back to this project a year from now, doe. As for the time being (15/01/2024), this is how I would rate my skills: </p>
